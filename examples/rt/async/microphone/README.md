# Live Real-Time Example

This example demonstrates how to use the Speechmatics Python SDK to transcribe audio from a microphone in real-time. It requires `pyaudio` to be installed for the example to work correctly.

The SDK requires an API key to be set as an environment variable before it can be used. You can obtain an API key by signing up for a Speechmatics account at https://portal.speechmatics.com/dashboard

## Prerequisites

- Install Speechmatics RT SDK: `pip install speechmatics-rt`
- Export Speechmatics API key: `export SPEECHMATICS_API_KEY=YOUR-API-KEY`
- Install `pyaudio`: `pip install pyaudio`
