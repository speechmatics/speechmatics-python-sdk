    Chapter 1: The Beginning
    
    In the realm of streaming text-to-speech, we embark on a journey of real-time audio generation.
    Each sentence flows seamlessly into the next, creating a continuous stream of synthesized speech.
    
    The technology behind this process involves breaking down large texts into manageable chunks,
    processing them through advanced neural networks, and delivering audio incrementally.
    
    This approach enables immediate playback, reduced memory usage, and better user experience
    for applications dealing with long-form content like audiobooks, articles, and documents.
