    List of speakers to focus on, ignore and how to deal with speakers that are not

    a new session.

    Parameters:
        focus_speakers: List of speaker IDs to focus on. When enabled, only these speakers are
            emitted as finalized frames and other speakers are considered passive. Words from
            other speakers are still processed, but only emitted when a focussed speaker has
            also said new words. A list of labels (e.g. `S1`, `S2`) or identifiers of known
            speakers (e.g. `speaker_1`, `speaker_2`) can be used.
            Defaults to [].

        ignore_speakers: List of speaker IDs to ignore. When enabled, these speakers are
            excluded from the transcription and their words are not processed. Their speech
            will not trigger any VAD or end of utterance detection. By default, any speaker
            with a label starting and ending with double underscores will be excluded (e.g.
            `__ASSISTANT__`).
            Defaults to [].

        focus_mode: Speaker focus mode for diarization. When set to `DiarizationFocusMode.RETAIN`,
            the STT engine will retain words spoken by other speakers (not listed in `ignore_speakers`)
            and process them as passive speaker frames. When set to `DiarizationFocusMode.IGNORE`,
            the STT engine will ignore words spoken by other speakers and they will not be processed.

    A framework-independent configuration object for the Speechmatics Voice Agent. This uses
    utility functions to create `TranscriptionConfig` and `AudioConfig` objects and also retain
    agent configuration for the `VoiceAgentClient`.

    Parameters:
        operating_point: Operating point for transcription accuracy vs. latency tradeoff. It is
            recommended to use OperatingPoint.ENHANCED for most use cases. Defaults to
            OperatingPoint.ENHANCED.

        domain: Domain for Speechmatics API. Defaults to None.

        language: Language code for transcription. Defaults to `en`.

        output_locale: Output locale for transcription, e.g. `en-GB`. Defaults to None.

        max_delay: Maximum delay in seconds for transcription. This forces the STT engine to
            speed up the processing of transcribed words and reduces the interval between partial
            and final results. Lower values can have an impact on accuracy. Defaults to 0.7.

        end_of_utterance_silence_trigger: Maximum delay in seconds for end of utterance trigger.
            The delay is used to wait for any further transcribed words before emitting the final
            word frames. The value must be lower than max_delay.
            Defaults to 0.2.

        end_of_utterance_max_delay: Maximum delay in seconds for end of utterance delay.
            The delay is used to wait for any further transcribed words before emitting the final
            word frames. The value must be greater than end_of_utterance_silence_trigger.
            Defaults to 10.0.

        end_of_utterance_mode: End of utterance delay mode. When ADAPTIVE is used, the delay
            can be adjusted on the content of what the most recent speaker has said, such as
            rate of speech and whether they have any pauses or disfluencies. When FIXED is used,
            the delay is fixed to the value of `end_of_utterance_delay`. Use of NONE disables
            end of utterance detection and uses a fallback timer.
            Defaults to `EndOfUtteranceMode.FIXED`.

        additional_vocab: List of additional vocabulary entries. If you supply a list of
            additional vocabulary entries, the this will increase the weight of the words in the
            vocabulary and help the STT engine to better transcribe the words.
            Defaults to [].

        punctuation_overrides: Punctuation overrides. This allows you to override the punctuation
            in the STT engine. This is useful for languages that use different punctuation
            than English. See documentation for more information.
            Defaults to None.

        enable_diarization: Enable speaker diarization. When enabled, the STT engine will
            determine and attribute words to unique speakers. The speaker_sensitivity
            parameter can be used to adjust the sensitivity of diarization.
            Defaults to False.

        speaker_sensitivity: Diarization sensitivity. A higher value increases the sensitivity
            of diarization and helps when two or more speakers have similar voices.
            Defaults to 0.5.

        max_speakers: Maximum number of speakers to detect. This forces the STT engine to cluster
            words into a fixed number of speakers. It should not be used to limit the number of
            speakers, unless it is clear that there will only be a known number of speakers.
            Defaults to None.

        prefer_current_speaker: Prefer current speaker ID. When set to true, groups of words close
            together are given extra weight to be identified as the same speaker.
            Defaults to False.

        speaker_config: DiarizationSpeakerConfig to configure the speakers to focus on, ignore and
            how to deal with speakers that are not in focus.

        known_speakers: List of known speaker labels and identifiers. If you supply a list of
            labels and identifiers for speakers, then the STT engine will use them to attribute
            any spoken words to that speaker. This is useful when you want to attribute words
            to a specific speaker, such as the assistant or a specific user. Labels and identifiers
            can be obtained from a running STT session and then used in subsequent sessions.
            Identifiers are unique to each Speechmatics account and cannot be used across accounts.
            Refer to our examples on the format of the known_speakers parameter.
            Defaults to [].

        include_results: Include word data in the response. This is useful for debugging and
            understanding the STT engine's behavior. Defaults to False.

        enable_preview_features: Enable preview features using a preview endpoint provided by
            Speechmatics. Defaults to False.

        sample_rate: Audio sample rate for streaming. Defaults to 16000.
